subtitle: Collection of useful information before building a COVID ventilator

In the last couple of weeks hundreds of engineers and hobbists were coming up with creative solutions to help to fight Covid and save human lifes. 
We were also trying to come up with safe alternatives to ventilators. As a biomedical engineer, I think the research I did to compare the methods and currently available alternatives might be useful for others, before spending weeks on researching this topic. 

## 1. Mechanical ventilation essentials
To get a better understanding of the topic, I've followed an online course (it's free for the duration of COVID-19 outbreak) made for professionals. The course takes about 2 hours, and it walks through the different types of ventilation controls, explains the ventilator parameters, talks about ARDS and pressure control as well.

## 2. Volume versus pressure control



**Take home message: Patients with ARDS should be ventilated in lung protective ways, using Pressure Control.**



## 3. The patient is intubated / has no spontaneous breathing



## 4. The patient has spontaneous breathing and breathing support is enough

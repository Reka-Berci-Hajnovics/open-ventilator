subtitle: Collection of useful information before building a COVID ventilator
---


In the last couple of weeks hundreds of engineers and hobbists were coming up with creative solutions to help to fight Covid and save human lifes. 
We were also trying to come up with safe alternatives to ventilators. As a biomedical engineer, I think the research I did to compare the methods and currently available alternatives might be useful for others, before spending weeks on researching this topic. 

## Mechanical ventilation essentials
To get a better understanding of the topic, I've followed an online course (it's free for the duration of COVID-19 outbreak) made for professionals. The course takes about 2 hours, and it walks through the different types of ventilation controls, explains the ventilator parameters, talks about ARDS and pressure control as well.

## Volume versus pressure control
When using mechanical ventilation volume control mode and pressure control modes are available.  Patients with COVID-19 have acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS). In ARDS the alveoli of the lungs are affected. **When treating patients with lung disease such as ARDS it is common to switch to pressure control mode, because it is more lung protective!**

The pressure control mode and why is it suitable for patients with ARDS is explained in the next section.


## Pressure control mode - the patient has no spontaneous breathing
At pressure control mode a max. pressure is maintaned for a couple of seconds, this is the inhalation. Then the pressure is decreasing to the level of min. pressure, this is the exhalation part. Since, the min. pressure is not zero, the lung is always inflated and the alveoli can't collapse.

Disadvantage of the pressure control is, that if the patient has spontaneous breathing, it might not match the patients breathing rhythm and it can cause anxiety. In worst case,(e.g. coughing) it can damage the lungs of the patient.

### Ventilation possibilities when the patient has no spontaneus breathing ###

I. Volume control mode:
  1. Medical ventilator - best solution if available
  2. Ambu bag/ bag valve mask - hand-held - This solution is possible only if enough personnel is available and it was designed to be used only for a couple of hours. 
  3. Ambu bag/ bag valve mask - motorized - There are hundreds of solutions motorizing Ambu bags. **This is a high risk solution!  What should be kept in mind, that the Ambu bag is designed to be used for a couple of hours. This means, that they need to be continously monitored by the personnel to detect in time if the bag needs to be changed. In addition, pressure control mode is more lung protective, this mode can cause damage to the lungs.**
Although if this is the last solution, then probably the best solution is provided by the [oxygen.protofy.xyz](https://www.oxygen.protofy.xyz/)

II. Pressure control mode:
  1. Medical ventilator - best solution if available
  2. Air pump with sensors and filters - good solution, if tested and clinically approved. Best and safest solution is developed at the TU Delft: [operationair](https://www.operationair.org/en)
  
  When the patient has no spontaneous breathing, using any other device than a medical ventilator is risky.
  
  **Therefore, we suggest, to use alternative solutions on patients, who does have spontaneous breathing as an additional support.This way, the recovering patients can be removed from the medical ventilators, and the ventilators can be used on patients who are in worse condition.**
The available possibilites for patients who does have spontaneous breathing are discussed in the next section.
  
  
  
## The patient has spontaneous breathing and breathing support is enough



  2. CPAP device - good solution if available, by keeping a constant positive pressure, it prevents the alveoli from collapsing. **Important to use filters and masks with CPAP machines otherwise the virus is ventilated from the machine or patient into the air!!**
